________________________________________
worldwide license to use and display the Licensed Marks as Trademarks (other than as corporate or trade names) on or in the Licensed Items or in connection with the production, use, distribution, offer for sale or sale thereof. Subject to Licensor’s rights under Section 7(b), Licensee is under no obligation to use the Licensed Marks.
(iii) Exclusivity. To support the exclusive nature of the above licenses, Licensor agrees that, during the Term, Licensor and its Affiliates will not use or license to any other Person the right to use (A) any Trademark containing the word “Busch” or “Bush” (or any translation or transliteration thereof) in the Field of Use or in connection with Licensed Items used to promote amusement or theme parks; or (B) any Trademark containing the words “Busch Garden(s)” or “Bush Garden(s)” as a whole (or any translation or transliteration thereof) for any purpose. For clarity, this Section 2(a)(iii) shall not prohibit, limit or restrict Licensor, its Affiliates or their licensees from using or licensing any Trademark containing the word “Busch” or “Bush” without the word “Garden” or “Gardens” on any merchandise, promotional items, or marketing or advertising materials (including those used to promote the sale and consumption of beer and other beverages) so long as such use does not suggest a corporate or “Busch”- branded endorsement of any other amusement or theme park or its operator. As an illustrative but not limiting example, Licensor may advertise its products within an amusement or theme park, or for morale purposes, host a corporate-sponsored free day for employees at a competing amusement or theme park, but Licensor and its Affiliates will not serve as a corporate or brand-based sponsor for any other amusement or theme park or its operator. Without limiting the foregoing, this Agreement will not be violated if Licensor or its Affiliates use the words (A) “Busch” or “Bush” in a non-trademark manner or in a manner consistent with “fair use”; or (B) “Busch Gardens” in a non-trademark manner to describe accurately Licensor’s corporate history and the transactions described in the Purchase Agreement and herein.
(b) Sublicensing.
(i) Licensee may sublicense the rights granted in Section 2(a) without the right to further sublicense such rights (other than as expressly indicated herein), as follows:
A. to advertisers, distributors, vendors, suppliers and other Persons, with no further right to sublicense such rights, as necessary or desirable for Licensee to exercise its own rights under the license in Section 2(a), but not for any other use (including any use for their own benefit) by such advertisers, distributors, vendors, suppliers and other Persons (an “Ancillary Sublicense”);
B. to one or more Persons who leases one or more Theme Parks or operates or manages one or more of the Theme Parks on Licensee’s behalf (a “Theme Park Operator”), with the right of such Theme Park Operator to grant Ancillary Sublicenses but no other sublicenses, provided that Licensee or its agents must directly supervise all material aspects of such Theme Parks’ design and operation;
C. as permitted in Section 12(b); and
D. to its Affiliates, so long as they remain Affiliates of Licensee, who have the further sublicensing rights in subsections (A)-(C) above.

(ii) Each sublicense granted by Licensee or Sublicensee shall be in writing and shall provide that Licensor is a third party beneficiary of such sublicense, and that Licensor is entitled to enforce directly upon the Sublicensee the terms of this Agreement relating to the Licensed Marks, including the sampling and quality control obligations set forth herein.

A material breach by a Sublicensee of its sublicense (and Licensee’s failure to prevent same) shall not constitute a material breach of this Agreement by Licensee for purposes of termination this Agreement pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) unless (y) such Sublicensee does not cure such material breach within forty-five (45) days after (1) receipt of notice from either Licensor (with a copy to Licensee) or Licensee or (2) Licensor notifying Licensee of such matter, or (z) Licensee has not, after using reasonable best efforts to have its Sublicensee cure such material breach, terminated the applicable sublicense at the end of such forty-five (45) day period.
(c) Domain Names.
(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and subject to Section 3, Licensee may use domain names included in the Licensed Marks only as domain names and not as any other type of Trademark.
(ii) Without limiting transfers in Section 2(c)(iii), Licensee shall not, and shall specify in any sublicense agreement that such Sublicensee shall not register or apply for any Internet domain name that contains any of the Licensed Marks or any Trademark that is confusingly similar thereto.
(iii) During the Term, Licensor agrees that it or its Affiliates will remain the registrant of all domain names included in the Licensed Marks; provided however, that Licensor shall give Licensee at least thirty (30) days advance notice of its intent to cancel or no longer maintain any such domain names, and at Licensee’s request

If either Party discovers any “Busch Gardens” Trademark (other than a corporate name or trade name) that is owned by Licensor or its Affiliates (other than Licensee and its subsidiaries) and used in the Theme Parks as of the Effective Date, the Parties will amend the definition of “Licensed Marks” to include same.
(e) Combination/Composite Marks. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Licensee nor any Sublicensee shall use the Licensed Marks: (i) as part of any composite Trademark bearing Licensee’s or any Sublicensee’s Trademarks; (ii) as part of any composite Trademark bearing any Trademark of any Person; or (iii) as a part of any other combination or composite mark. The foregoing restriction shall not prohibit Licensee or its Affiliates from using the Licensed Marks in connection with the names of any New Parks owned by Licensee or its Affiliates.
(f) Products/Services. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Licensed Marks shall not be used by Licensee to identify products or services other than Licensed Items or within the Field of Use.

(h) Reservation of Rights. This Agreement provides Licensee with no right to use any Trademark or other intellectual property of Licensor or its Affiliates, except for the Licensed Marks as expressly permitted by and subject to this Agreement. All rights in the Licensed Marks other than the rights expressly granted to Licensee by this Agreement are hereby reserved to Licensor.
(i) Websites. Each Party agrees that it and its Affiliates will not link its websites to the other Party’s and its Affiliates’ websites, without consent, except as provided for in the Purchase Agreement and/or the Sponsorship Agreement.

Licensee shall, and shall provide in any sublicense agreement that such Sublicensee shall, submit all requests for approval of a New Trademark Use in writing and furnish to Licensor’s designated contact on Exhibit C samples of and/or applicable information relating to such proposed New Trademark Use. Licensor shall have twenty (20) days from the date Licensor receives such samples or information to object to any proposed New Trademark Use, and if Licensor does not respond within such twenty (20) day period, then Licensee shall resubmit such approval materials and provide notice of such resubmission to Licensor’s additional contacts on Exhibit C, with a prominent header on the top page or front of such submission saying “FINAL NOTICE FOR APPROVAL” or words of similar import.

Upon the termination of this Agreement (or of any license to a Theme Park granted): (i) Licensee shall terminate all further use of the Licensed Marks as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event more than ninety (90) days after termination (provided that any such permitted post-termination use complies with the terms of this Agreement), and at Licensor’s option, return to Licensor or irretrievably destroy or delete all materials bearing the Licensed Marks; and (ii) except as permitted by the foregoing, any and all rights to the Licensed Marks granted hereunder shall immediately cease and without further act or instrument revert to Licensor.

8. Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Indemnification. Licensee acknowledges that it will have no claims under this Agreement against Licensor, its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents and representatives (each, a “Licensor Indemnified Party”) for any damage to property or injury to Persons arising out of the operation of Licensee’s business. Licensee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Licensor Indemnified Party, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Licensor, from and against all third-party demands, claims, injuries, losses, damages, actions, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments, liabilities and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, court costs and other legal expenses (collectively, “Claims”), arising out of or connected with, except as otherwise provided in and without limiting the Purchase Agreement: (i) the Theme Parks and their operation after the Closing Date (excluding claims to the extent caused in whole or in part by such Licensor Indemnified Party’s gross negligence), (ii) Licensee’s promotions of the Theme Parks or Licensee’s methods of marketing or promoting the Theme Parks, (iii) any website located at a domain name included in the Licensed Marks, (iv) any Licensed Item, (v) infringement, dilution or other violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights in relation to any use of the Licensed Marks by Licensee not made by the Licensor or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Date, or (iii) any breach by Licensee of any provision of this Agreement or of any representation or warranty made by Licensee in this Agreement. No approval by Licensor of any action by Licensee shall affect any right of Licensor to indemnification hereunder. Licensor agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensee, its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents and representatives, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Licensee, from and against all third-party Claims arising out of or connected with (i) Licensor’s operation of its business (but excluding Claims covered by Licensee’s indemnity obligations in Section 8(a) above)) or (ii) any breach by Licensor of any provision of this Agreement or of any representation or warranty made by Licensor in this Agreement.
(b) Insurance. Licensee shall obtain and maintain during the term of this Agreement comprehensive general liability insurance coverage, including products, premises, completed operations and contractual liability insurance (to the extent that such contractual liability insurance can be obtained through commercially reasonable efforts), naming Licensor and its Affiliates as additional insureds. Such insurance shall be underwritten by insurers with an A.M. Best rating of A- or above and shall be written for limits of not less than the Coverage Amount each occurrence combined, for bodily injury,

________________________________________
including death and property damage. Licensee shall furnish Licensor promptly upon the execution of this Agreement and annually thereafter on each anniversary date of this Agreement with a certificate of insurance stating thereon the Coverage Amount, the limits of liability, the period of coverage, the parties insured (including Licensee and Licensor), and the insurer’s agreement not to terminate or materially modify such insurance without endeavoring to notify Licensor in writing at least ninety (90) days before such termination or modification. Coverage maintained for Licensor by Licensee shall be exhausted before any insurance maintained by Licensor shall attach. Coverage shall be on an occurrence rather than a claims made basis. In no event shall Licensee make any use of the Licensed Marks before Licensor’s receipt of such insurance certificate. The existence of the insurance coverage shall not mitigate, alter or waive the indemnity provisions in this Agreement. Licensor shall not be responsible for the payment of the premiums, charge taxes, assessments or other costs for the insurance coverage provided by Licensee.
(c) Procedure. The provisions of Section 7.5 (“Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures”) and Section 7.6 (“Payments”) of the Purchase Agreement shall govern indemnification under this Section 8, mutatis mutandis.
9. Licensor’s Remedies.
Each Party acknowledges and agrees that there would be no adequate remedy at law for its failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement and agrees that, in the event of such failure and in addition to the rights provided by Section 8, each Party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction and such other and further relief as any court with jurisdiction may deem just and proper, without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages. This remedy is separate and apart from any other remedy a Party may have.
10. Maintenance.
Licensee shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, at Licensee’s sole cost and expense, to maintain and renew all Licensed Marks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any other federal, state or local agency or foreign equivalent, or any other registry (including domain name registries) or equivalent, as applicable, which shall include the filing of all necessary documentation and payment of all renewal, maintenance and other fees. Licensor will reasonably cooperate with Licensee in such maintenance efforts, at Licensee’s sole cost and expense, including by executing all documents and performing all acts reasonably requested by Licensee in connection therewith. Licensee shall give Licensor at least thirty (30) days advance notice of its intent to no longer maintain any such Licensed Marks, and at Licensor’s request and expense, will allow Licensor to do so.

11. Security Interest.
To protect Licensee from and against all damages of any kind or nature resulting from Licensor’s rejection of this agreement in bankruptcy, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a continuing security interest in and first priority lien upon the Licensed Marks (the “Security Interest”). Licensor shall execute any documents and perform all further acts, including with all applicable government agencies and authorities, at Licensee’s expense, which Licensee reasonably requests in order to evidence and perfect the Security Interest. Upon termination of this Agreement as to all Theme Parks under Section 7(b) (but not if Licensor rejects this Agreement in bankruptcy), the Security Interest shall automatically terminate (subject to Section 12(b)) and Licensee shall execute any documents and perform all further acts, including with all applicable government agencies and authorities, at Licensor’s expense, which Licensor reasonably requests in order to evidence and record such termination.
12. Assignment and Sales.
(a) Complete Sale to a Single Acquirer. Licensee must, and may without consent, assign this Agreement in whole (i) if Licensee (A) divests all of the Theme Parks (or the Persons who own them) as one or more divested entities to be acquired by a single Person that is not a Competing Person) or (B) sells all of the Theme Parks (or the Persons who own them) to a Person that is not a Competing Person or (ii) in any transaction described in Section 12(b)(iii). For clarity, Licensee cannot retain any of its rights under this Agreement unless Licensee continues to own at least one Theme Park.
(b) Sale to Partial Acquirer. If Licensee either (i) divests less than all of the Theme Parks (or the Persons who own them) as one or more divested entities to be acquired by one or more Persons (none of which may be a Competing Person) or (ii) sells less than all of the Theme Parks (or the Persons who own them) to one or more Persons (none of which may be a Competing Person), the following provisions apply. For clarity, after any transaction in this Section 12(b), only one Person at a time, the person who is “Licensee” hereunder, can hold the right under this Agreement to use the Licensed Marks in connection with New Parks (e.g, to build or rebrand amusement or theme parks under the Licensed Marks).
(i) If the transaction involves a single divested entity or acquirer (for example, Licensee owns 10 Theme Parks: Licensee retains 5 Theme Parks and sells 5 Theme Parks to one Person), Licensee may, without consent, (A) assign this Agreement in whole to such entity or acquirer, and at Licensee’s request, Licensor must consent to a grant by the acquirer or divested entity to Licensee of an Existing Park Sublicense or (B) retain this Agreement and grant an Existing Park Sublicense to such entity or acquirer. In the event that any party grants an Existing Park Sublicense under this Section 12(b)(i), such Existing Park Sublicense will require, that if sublicensor’s rights under this Agreement are terminated for any reason (or rejected in bankruptcy), the sublicensee will enter into a direct license with Licensor on substantially similar terms as the Existing Park Sublicense for the applicable Theme Parks, and Licensor agrees to enter into such direct license.
 
- 15 -
________________________________________
(ii) If the transaction involves more than one divested entity or acquirer and Licensee continues to own at least one existing Theme Park (for example, Licensee owns 10 Theme Parks: Licensee retains 2 Theme Parks, sells 5 Theme Parks to one Person and sells 3 to another Person), Licensee may, without consent, (A) assign this Agreement in whole to one such entity or acquirer, and at Licensee’s request, Licensor must consent to a grant by the acquirer or divested entity to Licensee and any other divested entities or acquirers of one or more Existing Park Sublicenses; or (B) retain this Agreement and grant an Existing Park Sublicense to each such entity or acquirer. In the event that any party grants any Existing Park Sublicenses under this Section 12(b)(ii), such Existing Park Sublicenses will require, that if sublicensor’s rights under this Agreement are terminated for any reason (or rejected in bankruptcy), each such sublicensee will enter into a direct license with Licensor on substantially similar terms as the Existing Park Sublicense for the applicable Theme Parks, and Licensor agrees to enter into such direct license.
(iii) If the transaction involves more than one divested entity or acquirer, and Licensee will no longer continue to own at least one existing Theme Park (for example, Licensee owns 10 Theme Parks: Licensee sells 5 Theme Parks to one Person and sells 5 to another Person), Licensee must and may without consent, assign this Agreement in whole to one such entity or acquirer, and at Licensee’s request, Licensor must consent to a grant by the acquirer or divested entity to any other divested entities or acquirers of one or more Existing Park Sublicenses. Any such sublicense will require, that if sublicensor’s rights under this Agreement are terminated for any reason (or rejected in bankruptcy), each such sublicensee will enter into a direct license with Licensor on substantially similar terms as the Existing Park Sublicense for the applicable Theme Parks, and Licensor agrees to enter into such direct license.
(c) Sponsorship Agreement. Any assignee or sublicensee under an Existing Park Sublicense must promptly enter into an agreement with Licensor on terms substantially similar to the Sponsorship Agreement, with respect to the applicable Theme Parks.
(d) Other Rights. This Section 12 does not restrict Licensee from making any sale, lease or other disposition of any assets or rights relating to one or more Theme Parks without assigning or sublicensing this Agreement. For clarity, if Licensee sells one or more (but not all) of the Theme Parks but does not assign or sublicense this Agreement pursuant to Section 12(a) or 12(b), Licensee retains the right to exercise its rights under Section 12(a) or 12(b) in a future qualifying transaction.
(e) Assignment by Licensor. Licensor may not assign, transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of the Licensed Marks to any Person other than an Affiliate without first granting Licensee a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase them, and any assignee, transferee, or purchaser of the Licensed Marks must assume in writing all of Licensor’s obligations hereunder. Licensor may not assign this Agreement except to the then-current owner of the Licensed Marks.
 
- 16 -
________________________________________
(f) Other Transactions. Licensor agrees that Licensee may pledge or grant a lien in its rights in this Agreement and/or assume this Agreement in bankruptcy; provided that Licensee does not assign this Agreement to a Competing Person and subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as permitted in Section 12, neither Party may assign this Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(g) Effect of Assignment. Any purported sublicense or assignment granted in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio and of no force and effect. In the event of a permitted assignment, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors, assigns and transferees.
13. Miscellaneous.
(a) Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
(b) Notices. All notices or other communications required under the provisions of this Agreement shall be (i) in writing; (ii) delivered by hand; by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested or by facsimile transmission; and (iii) deemed given upon receipt. All notices or other communications shall be sent to the parties at the address set forth below, or at such other address as the parties shall have specified by written notice:

(c) Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement, exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York City (the “Chosen Courts”), and solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 13(b) of this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably designates C.T. Corporation as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before the Chosen Courts and each party hereto stipulates that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
(d) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Exhibits hereto) and the applicable provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement and Purchase Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters. Any representation, promise, or condition not explicitly set forth herein shall not be binding on any party. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be in writing specifically referencing and amending or modifying this Agreement and signed by an officer of each party.
(f) Nonwaiver. The failure of any party to assert or enforce any right arising under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right, or any other right arising hereunder. No waiver of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party charged with such waiver.
(g) Headings. Any headings or captions appearing in this Agreement are intended solely for convenience of reference and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement or define or limit any of the terms and conditions hereof.

________________________________________
(h) Relationship. The parties hereto are and shall remain independent contractors. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties. Neither party shall have the right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner to any third party.
(i) No Third-Party Rights. Nothing contained in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person or entity, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies resulting from this Agreement.
(j) Costs. Unless expressly stated to the contrary in this Agreement, all costs incurred by a party hereto in connection with its performance hereunder shall be borne by that party.
(k) Survival. Each of the provisions of this Agreement which are not, by the expressed terms of this Agreement, fully to be performed during the term of this Agreement including, without limitation, Sections 6(a), 7(f), 8(a), 9, 12(b) (as applicable) and 13 (as applicable) shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.
(l) Further Assurances. Licensor and Licensee agree to execute such further documentation and perform such further actions, including the recordation of such documentation with the appropriate authorities, as may be reasonably requested by the other party to evidence and effectuate further the purposes and intents set forth in this Agreement.
