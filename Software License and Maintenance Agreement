The Vendor shall give notice to CUSTOMER of all stages involved in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and shall consult with CUSTOMER where any step therein may have an adverse effect on CUSTOMER or its reputation in its market area. The Vendor shall not agree to any settlement which may result in CUSTOMER incurring any financial or other liability without the prior written consent of CUSTOMER.
Section 21 – Indemnity Against Infringement Claims
21.01 The Vendor shall indemnify and save harmless CUSTOMER from any suit or proceeding or threatened suit or proceeding brought against CUSTOMER based on a claim or claims that the Deliverables (or any part thereof) or any other materials or products provided by the Vendor or any conduct or act CUSTOMER is licensed to carry out hereunder infringes or constitutes wrongful use of any copyright, patent, registered industrial design, trade-mark or trade secret right of any third party (a “Proprietary Right” herein). CUSTOMER shall notify the Vendor in writing of any such suit or proceeding or threatened suit or proceeding promptly after CUSTOMER first learns of such suit or proceeding or threatened suit or proceeding. In the event of any claim of infringement or wrongful use of a Proprietary Right as aforesaid, the Vendor may either defend or settle such claim. The Vendor agrees to pay such damages and costs awarded against CUSTOMER or payable by CUSTOMER pursuant to a settlement agreement in connection with such suit or proceeding together with legal fees of CUSTOMER on a solicitor and his own client basis. The Vendor shall have complete control over any such suit or proceeding, including, without limitation, the right to settle on behalf of CUSTOMER or the Vendor on any terms the Vendor deems desirable (in the sole exercise of its discretion) and at no cost on CUSTOMER and which terms cause the least disruption or damage to CUSTOMER; however, the Vendor shall give notice to CUSTOMER of all stages involved in any such suit or proceeding and shall consult with CUSTOMER where any step therein may have an adverse effect on CUSTOMER or its reputation in its market area. The Vendor shall not agree to any settlement which may result in CUSTOMER incurring any financial or other liability without the prior written consent of CUSTOMER. CUSTOMER shall provide, at the Vendor’s cost, such assistance and cooperation as the Vendor may reasonably request from time to time in connection with the defence of any such suit or proceeding or threatened suit or proceeding. CUSTOMER shall have the right to be independently represented by counsel of its own choice.
21.02 If the use of any of the computer software programs provided by the Vendor hereunder is enjoined as a result of such action, the Vendor shall, at its option and expense:
(a)	obtain for CUSTOMER the right to continue using the computer software program in question;
(b)	modify the computer software program in question so that it no longer infringes, provided that it continues to operate, function and perform in substantially the same manner; or
(c)	request the return of the infringing computer software program in question and refund all amounts paid by CUSTOMER to the Vendor in respect of such program, whereupon CUSTOMER shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to return all computer software programs provided by the Vendor hereunder for a full refund of all amounts paid by CUSTOMER to the Vendor under this Agreement, less an adjustment for the time during which CUSTOMER was able to successfully operate the Deliverables based on straight-line depreciation over five (5) years.
21.03 The Vendor shall have no liability hereunder for infringement claims based solely upon modifications by CUSTOMER to any computer software programs provided by the Vendor, which modifications cause the computer software program to become infringing.
Section 22 – Confidentiality
22.01 The Vendor shall be bound by an obligation of strict confidence to CUSTOMER in respect of any Confidential Information disclosed by or on behalf of CUSTOMER to the Vendor or developed by the Vendor for CUSTOMER. The Vendor shall not:
(a)	disclose, either directly or indirectly, any such Confidential Information, or any part thereof, to any person except as is specifically contemplated in this Agreement; and
(b)	use any such Confidential Information, or any part thereof, for any purpose, except as is specifically contemplated within this Agreement, without the prior written consent of CUSTOMER and on terms and conditions satisfactory to CUSTOMER in its sole discretion.
22.02 The obligations of confidentiality and non-use set out in Section 22.01 shall not apply to any Confidential Information which:
(a)	is in the public domain, without such disclosure being as a result, directly or indirectly, of a breach of the obligations of confidentiality by the Vendor or its officers, agents, employees or subcontractors;
(b)	was known to the Vendor prior to its disclosure to the Vendor by CUSTOMER, the reasonable proof of which lies upon Vendor;
(c)	is released or disclosed to the public by CUSTOMER; or
(d)	is released or disclosed to the public as a result of the ordinary operation of the business to be carried out as contemplated under this Agreement.
22.03 CUSTOMER acknowledges that the Licensed Computer Programs provided by the Vendor under this Agreement contain Confidential Information belonging to the Vendor. CUSTOMER shall not sublicense, distribute, transmit, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise divulge, directly or indirectly, by any means or any form, the Licensed Computer Programs, or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of the Vendor. CUSTOMER shall take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the Licensed Computer Programs, or any portion thereof, are not made available or disclosed by CUSTOMER or by any of its employees to any other person. If CUSTOMER breaches this Section 22.03, and if CUSTOMER has not remedied the breach within thirty (30) days after written notice from the Vendor, the Vendor shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by notice in writing given to CUSTOMER. Upon such termination, CUSTOMER shall deliver to the Vendor all material furnished by the Vendor pertaining to the Licensed Computer Programs, and shall warrant in writing that all copies thereof have been returned to the Vendor or destroyed. CUSTOMER agrees that in addition to all other remedies upon a breach of this Section 22.03, the Vendor shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the continuance of such breach whether or not the Vendor has given notice to CUSTOMER of the breach and whether or not the thirty (30) days have expired after notice is given.
Section 23 – Default
23.01 A breach or default by the Vendor of any of the terms, conditions, warranties or representations provided in this Agreement or in carrying out any of its obligations under the Agreement shall give rise to an event of a material default by the Vendor (herein called the “Default”). CUSTOMER may, at its option, terminate the rights and obligations under this Agreement upon giving the Vendor notice in writing of the specific details of the alleged Default and where the Vendor has not remedied such Default within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice. For the purposes of this Section, termination for default will be effective thirty (30) days after receipt of the Default notice by the Vendor unless the Default has been remedied or the Vendor is diligently pursuing the completion of the remedy to the Default to the satisfaction of CUSTOMER and setting a date for completion of that remedy.
23.02 Where:
(a)	the Vendor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors generally;
(b)	the Vendor or other third party files a petition or makes a proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (Canada) or similar equivalent legislation of another applicable jurisdiction;
(c)	a receiving order is made or a petition is filed under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) or other applicable legislation against the Vendor, and the Vendor does not contest such receiving order or such petition in good faith;
(d)	the Vendor makes an application under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (Canada) or similar or equivalent legislation of another applicable jurisdiction;
(e)	a resolution is passed for, or a judgment or order is issued by any court of competent jurisdiction ordering, the winding up or other liquidation or dissolution of the Vendor; or
(f)	any receiver, manager, receiver-manager, liquidator or trustee of the property, assets or undertaking of the Vendor is appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement or similar instrument, and such appointment is not revoked or withdrawn within thirty (30) days of the appointment, provided that such period of thirty (30) days shall be extended to one hundred and twenty (120) days after such appointment if the Vendor demonstrates to the satisfaction of CUSTOMER, acting reasonably, that it is contesting such appointment in good faith,
then a triggering event shall be deemed to have occurred (herein called a “Triggering Event”). Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, CUSTOMER may elect, at its option and in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the rights and obligations under this Agreement for default by giving the Vendor at least ten (10) days’ written notice of such termination.
23.03 Upon the giving of a notice referred to in Section 23.01 or 23.02, the Vendor shall have no claim for further payment, but shall be liable to CUSTOMER for any amounts, including milestone payments, paid by CUSTOMER for Deliverables not yet delivered to and accepted by CUSTOMER and for all losses and damages which may be suffered by CUSTOMER by reason of the default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including any increase in the cost incurred by CUSTOMER in procuring the Deliverables from another source. CUSTOMER shall further have the option to reject the Deliverables provided to CUSTOMER by the Vendor in exchange for the return of all amounts paid by CUSTOMER to the Vendor hereunder, less an adjustment for the length of time CUSTOMER enjoyed the benefit of the Deliverables based on straight-line depreciation over ten (10) years.
23.04 Upon termination of the Agreement under this Section, CUSTOMER may require the Vendor to deliver to CUSTOMER any completed parts of the Deliverables which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the termination and any materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-progress which the Vendor has acquired or produced specifically in the fulfillment of the Agreement.
23.05 Subject to the deduction of any claim that CUSTOMER may have against the Vendor arising under the Agreement or out of the termination, CUSTOMER shall pay or credit to the Vendor the value, determined on the basis of the Contract Price, of all completed parts of the Deliverables delivered to and accepted by CUSTOMER, and shall pay or credit to the Vendor the cost to the Vendor that CUSTOMER considers reasonable in respect of all materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-progress delivered to CUSTOMER pursuant to a direction under Section 23.04 and accepted by CUSTOMER, but in no event shall the aggregate of the amounts paid by CUSTOMER under the Agreement to the date of termination and any amounts payable pursuant to this Section exceed either the Contract Price or the payment the Vendor would have been entitled to receive if the Vendor had completed all Deliverables the Vendor was working on at the time of termination, and the Deliverables had been completed to the satisfaction of CUSTOMER.
23.06 Title to all materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-progress and finished work, in respect of which payment is made to the Vendor, and all rights related thereto shall, upon such payment being made, pass to and vest in CUSTOMER, where applicable, unless already so vested under any other provision of the Agreement, and such materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-progress and finished work shall be delivered to the order of CUSTOMER, but CUSTOMER will not accept and will not pay for materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-progress that would not have been required to carry out CUSTOMER’S obligations hereunder or that exceed what would have been required to carry out CUSTOMER’S obligations hereunder.

Upon a termination notice being given, the Vendor shall cease work (including the development and procuring of materials) in accordance with and to the extent specified in the notice, but shall proceed to complete such part or parts of the Deliverables as are not affected by the termination notice. CUSTOMER may, at any time or from time to time, give one or more additional termination notices with respect to any or all parts of Deliverables not terminated by any previous termination notice.
24.02 In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to Section 24.01, the Vendor shall be entitled to be paid, to the extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for purposes of performing the Agreement and to the extent that the Vendor has not already been so paid or reimbursed by CUSTOMER:
(a)	on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed portions of the Deliverables that are inspected and accepted in accordance with the Agreement, whether completed before, or after and in compliance with the instructions contained in the termination notice;
(b)	the cost to the Vendor plus a fair and reasonable profit thereon for all work terminated by the instructions contained in the termination notice before complete, subject to any modifications thereof that CUSTOMER may in its absolute discretion consider to be appropriate in the circumstances;
(c)	the amount of any capital expenditures actually incurred only if they were specifically approved in writing by CUSTOMER for the purpose of the Agreement, less any depreciation in respect thereof already taken into account in determining cost, to the extent that the capital expenditures are properly apportionable to the performance of the Agreement;
(d)	all costs of and incidental to the termination of the Deliverables or part thereof, including the cost of cancellation of obligations incurred by the Vendor with respect to the terminated Deliverables or part thereof, the cost of and incidental to the taking of an inventory of materials, components, work-in-progress and finished work on hand related to the Agreement at the date of the termination, and the cost of preparation of necessary accounts and statements with respect to work performed to the effective date of the termination and commitments made by the Vendor with respect to the terminated portions of the Deliverables, but not the cost of severance payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer required by reason of the termination except wages that the Vendor is obligated by statute to pay to employees whose hiring was expressly approved in writing by CUSTOMER for the purpose of the Agreement.
24.03 No payment shall be made in respect of any of the Deliverables that have been or may be rejected after inspection as not complying with the requirements of the Agreement.

24.05 Title to all materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-progress and finished work, in respect of which payment is made to the Vendor, and all rights related thereto shall, upon such payment being made, pass to and vest in CUSTOMER, where applicable, unless already so vested under any other provision of the Agreement, and such materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-progress and finished work shall be delivered to the order of CUSTOMER, but CUSTOMER will not accept and will not pay for materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-progress that would not have been required to provide the Deliverables or that exceed what would have been required to provide the Deliverables.
24.06 The Vendor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of or directly or indirectly arising out of any action taken or termination notice given by CUSTOMER under this Section, except to the extent that this Section expressly provides.
Section 25 – Consequences of Termination

Section 26 – Remedies

Section 27 – Dispute Resolution Mechanism
27.01 Nothing in this Section 27 interferes with the right of either party to seek or to pursue any remedy available at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.
27.02 From time to time, as disputes may arise between the parties, the parties expect that such disputes will be resolved through open, frank and honest discussion by the representatives of the parties.

A submission of a dispute to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Section will not restrict the rights of either party to insist on its rights under this Agreement or to seek such remedies as may be available by law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction in respect thereof or in respect of any other dispute.
27.03 The arbitration tribunal shall be formed of three (3) arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party and the third to be appointed by the first two, or, in the event of failure to appoint within thirty (30) days, by a Justice of the [______________________].
