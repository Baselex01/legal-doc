#[NAME OF TESTATOR/TESTATRIX] 

I, _________________________, a resident of and domiciled in _______________, New 
York, make, publish and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, revoking all wills and 
codicils at any time heretofore made by me. 
FIRST: I direct that the expenses of my last illness and funeral, the expenses of the 
administration of my estate, and all estate, inheritance and similar taxes payable with respect to 
property included in my estate, whether or not passing under this will, and any interest or 
penalties thereon, shall be paid out of my residuary estate, without apportionment and with no 
right of reimbursement from any recipient of any such property. The provisions of this Article 
FIRST shall not apply to the extent that contrary provisions concerning the payment or 
apportionment of any such taxes have been or shall be made in any inter vivos instrument 
executed by me relating to any insurance, trusts, gifts or other transfers, jointly owned property 
or accounts, or property subject to power of appointment. 
SECOND: I give all tangible personal property owned by me at the time of my death, 
including without limitation personal effects, clothing, jewelry, furniture, furnishings, household 
goods, automobiles and other vehicles, together with all insurance policies relating thereto, to 
those of my children _________________________ and _________________________ who 
survive me, in substantially equal shares, to be divided between them as they shall agree, or if 
they cannot agree, as my Executors shall determine. 
THIRD: I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my property and estate, both real and 
personal, of whatever kind and wherever located, that I own or to which I shall be in any manner 
entitled at the time of my death (collectively referred to as my "residuary estate"), to the trustee 
under the following trust to be held and disposed of in accordance with the terms, covenants and 
conditions of such trust: _________________________ Living Trust dated _______________, 
20__.
FOURTH: If any property of my estate vests in absolute ownership in a minor or 
incompetent, my Executors, at any time and without court authorization, may: distribute the 
whole or any part of such property to the beneficiary; or use the whole or any part for the health, 
education, maintenance and support of the beneficiary; or distribute the whole or any part to a 
guardian, committee or other legal representative of the beneficiary, or to a custodian for the 
beneficiary under any gifts to minors or transfers to minors act, or to the person or persons with 
whom the beneficiary resides. Evidence of any such distribution or the receipt therefor executed 
by the person to whom the distribution is made shall be a full discharge of my Executors from 
any liability with respect thereto, even though my Executors may be such person. If such 
beneficiary is a minor, my Executors may defer the distribution of the whole or any part of such 
property until the beneficiary attains the age of eighteen (18) years, and may hold the same as a

or furnish any bond, surety or other security in any jurisdiction. 
SIXTH: I grant to my Executors all powers conferred on executors under the New York 
Estates, Powers and Trusts Law, as amended, or any successor thereto, and all powers conferred 
upon executors wherever my Executors may act. I also grant to my Executors power to retain,

with any kind of property, real or personal, for cash or on credit; to borrow money and encumber 
or pledge any property to secure loans; to pay any legacy or distribute, divide or partition 
property in cash or in kind, or partly in kind, and to allocate different kinds of property,
