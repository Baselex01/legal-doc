# Letter of Intent

This Letter of Intent summarizes the principal terms and conditions of the proposed Agreement between ________________, (hereafter “Company”), and ____________, a _____________ corporation located at ___________________ (hereafter “Developer”), referred to jointly in this document as the “Parties." Subject to the conditions set forth below and to the successful negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”), which will fully reflect the understanding and agreement of the Parties, the Company and Developer intend to consummate the following Letter of Intent :

##1.	Nature of Proposed Agreement 

The Company intends to engage  Developer to provide development services to produce  a multimedia computer software product ( the “Product”).  The Top Level Design for the Product and its target platform are attached to this letter in attachment “A”.  The Parties agree to make every effort to complete the Product according to the Preliminary Schedule attached to this letter as attachment “B”.   The development services will be provided by Developer on a “Work-for-Hire” basis for a fixed Development Fee,  which is currently targeted by the Parties at approximately $________. The preliminary budget is attached to this document as attachment "C".

The Parties acknowledge that the precise amount of the Development Fee and a Final Delivery Schedule cannot be determined until a Detailed Design for the Product (Functional Specification) and a Development Plan based upon that design are completed.   The Parties, therefore, agree to develop the Product in Phases.  


##2.	Development Phases

Developer will develop the Product in Phases.  Each Phase has specific Deliverables from the Company and from Developer. The development will proceed through the following three phases:   Design Phase, Prototype Phase, and Production Phase.  Each Phase contains progress milestones, which trigger a payment for development services from the Company to Developer.

##3.	Design phase:

In the Design Phase, Developer produces and delivers The Detailed Design Specifications ("Specifications") which includes the Functional Specification document,  screen layouts and designs,  character designs,  and color treatments.   The Specifications determine the development plan,  budget, delivery milestones, approval process, change order process and other items in the Agreement.  During the Design Phase, Developer creates the Development Plan, the Final Delivery Schedule and submits the Final Development Fee as a firm, fixed price.
   
The Parties acknowledge that the Design Phase is an iterative,  subjective,  creative process.  Using the Top Level Design as a point of departure,  and affording The Company meaningful consultation,  Developer will create Version 1.0 of the Detailed Design Specification.  Developer will present the Specification to the Company.  The Company will respond to the Detailed Design Specification,  and Developer will modify Version 1.0 and produce Version 1.1 of the Detailed Design Specification. 
   
The Company will compensate Developer $_____________ for delivery of the Detailed Design Specification through Version 1.1 of the Detailed Design Specification.    Thereafter, the Company will compensate Developer on a time and materials basis for subsequent Versions to the Detailed Design Specification.  Developer will quote reasonable rates and estimates for completion of requested subsequent Versions.


##4.	Prototype Phase:

In the Prototype Phase, Developer produces and delivers a Proof of Concept - a working "mini-" version of the product delivered in CD-ROM format, which includes final art, sound, animation, video, and software.  The Proof of Concept is a subset of the final product - representing no more than 10% of the total size of the final product.  The Proof of Concept will be suitable for demonstration purposes, focus testing, and preliminary marketing of the product.  The parties acknowledge that the Proof of Concept is used to determine if the design of the product is acceptable and the intended outcome of the product can be realized if development moves forward.  The parties may determine to re-design the product upon review of the Proof of Concept.  In such an event the parties will negotiate in good faith any modifications to the design, the development plan, or the development budget.

The Company will compensate Developer $_____________ for delivery of the Proof of Concept through Version 1.1 of the Proof of Concept.    Thereafter, The Company will compensate Developer on a time and materials basis for subsequent Versions to the Proof of Concept.  Developer will quote reasonable rates and estimates for completion of requested subsequent Versions.


##5. 	Production  Phase:

In the Production Phase, Developer completes all art, animation and sound development, title engineering and quality assurance.   Developer performs all work during the Production Phase according to the final, approved Detailed Design Specification.   Developer affords the Company ample and regular access to the work to assure conformance with the Detailed Design Specification. 

##6.	Payments and Terms

Payments are made according to a schedule agreed upon by the Parties.  The Agreement will provide that as compensation in full for the services performed and rights granted by Developer thereunder, the Company will pay Developer a Development Fee of approximately $_________.  The exact fee will be determined during the Design Phase, and will be based upon analysis and evaluation of the final, approved Detailed Design Specification.
  
The Company will also pay Developer a royalty of ___% of the Company’s net revenues on the Product.  “Net Revenues” will be defined in the Agreement, but will generally be equal to all sums received or due to the Company with respect to the Product, less cost of goods (Computed according to GAAP), credits for returns or promotional goods (subject to reasonable limitations), taxes, insurance and shipping.  In addition, before disbursing any royalties to Developer, the Company will be entitled to recoup all advances paid to Developer and to recoup other mutually agreed upon development costs paid by the Company.

##7.	Changes and Modifications

During the Production Phase of development of the Product,  the Company may request certain changes and modifications. Changes and Modifications will generally fall into two categories:  (1) Changes that must be made by Developer to the Product so that the Product conforms to the approved Detailed Design Specification or (2) Changes to the Detailed Design Specification.  Developer will make all changes necessary to conform the Product to the Detailed Design Specification at no cost.

 Changes to the Detailed Design Specification will be considered either “Soft” Changes or “Hard” Changes.  “Soft” Changes are those changes which do not materially affect the cost or time for development, and will be made at no additional cost to the agreed upon Development Fee.  “Hard” Changes are those changes that deviate significantly from the Specification, add features or functionality, or materially add to the cost and time of Development.  Developer will quote a reasonable additional fee to make “Hard” Changes,  and the Company will pay for any elected “Hard” changes at the next agreed-upon payment milestone.

##8.	Expenses

The Agreement will provide that each party will bear its own expenses of performance.

##9.	Ownership

As between Developer and the Company, Company will be the sole owner of the Product and Developer will not own any part thereof.  Developer will license to the Company all rights with respect to the Product which are necessary for the Company to reproduce, manufacture, market and distribute the Product via computer media worldwide on the PC and Macintosh platforms.  All rights not expressly granted in the Agreement will remain with Developer, including the right to develop versions of the Product for other platforms (including, but not limited to, interactive transmission) and the right to develop other versions of Product for the platforms described above (including, but not limited to “sequels”), provided that the Company will have a right of first refusal to publish any of the foregoing versions and to publish any subsidiary product (including, but not limited to, merchandise).  All performers, employees and independent contractors of Developer will sign agreements conveying sufficient rights to Developer so that no third party will have any colorable claim of rights with respect to the Product, and in particular, no right to receive royalties or other payments.  The Agreement will also include warranties, representations and indemnities concerning Developer’s ownership, non-infringement and other matters.  


##10.  	Subcontract

	The Company understands and agrees that Developer may subcontract certain portions of the development work.

	
##11.	Work During Pending Negotiations Notwithstanding Non-Binding Nature of Letter of Intent

	The parties agree that Developer will commence work on the Design Phase of the Product promptly upon execution of this Letter of Intent and payment to Developer by the Company for The Detailed Design Specification in the amount of $_________.  Developer will proceed diligently and use its reasonable best efforts to prepare the Product until such time as this Letter of Intent expires.

	It is the intention of the parties that this Paragraph 11 shall be binding upon the parties upon execution of this Letter of Intent by both parties, notwithstanding the non-binding nature of this Letter of Intent, and neither construed as creating, an obligation to enter into the Agreement or to otherwise proceed with the transactions proposed by this Letter of Intent beyond the limited extent agreed to under this Paragraph 11.

##12.	End User Technical Support

	The Agreement will provide that the Company is to be solely responsible for providing technical support to end users of the Product but that Developer will provide reasonable assistance to the Company with respect to any end user problems for a period of 90 days after shipment of the product to retail channels.  The parties may negotiate additional technical support to end users on a time and materials basis.

##13.	Confidentiality

	The parties agree that this Letter of Intent, and the Agreement, if any, will be maintained in confidence by both parties except to the extent of any mutually agreed upon disclosure of information.  The Agreement will contain a like provision.

##14.	Final Agreement

It is the intention of the parties that they will negotiate in good faith and execute the final Agreement by ______________.  In the event that the parties are unable to conclude a final Agreement by that date, this Letter of Intent and the intentions set forth herein shall expire.

This Letter of Intent merely summarizes certain of the principal terms and conditions proposed by the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by the parties.  This Letter of Intent is not an offer to enter into a contract, and no party’s signature hereon is intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, an acceptance of any offer by the other party.  Except as to Paragraph 11 and Paragraph 13, the parties hereby expressly agree and acknowledge that this Letter of Intent is merely an expression of intent among the parties and not intended to be legally binding and that the actions contemplated by the Letter of Intent shall in all respects be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the parties and their respective counsel.  Accordingly, except as to Paragraph 11 and Paragraph 13, the understandings contained herein will become binding, if at all, only at such time as such agreement has been duly executed by the parties, subject to any conditions set forth in such agreement being satisfied or waived.
